# Project
ðŸ’» 

This project was inspired by the java script 30 challenge, from the website https://javascript30.com/, this is a project where the interactions with the user were not inserted in the html, but rather through manipulation of elements in the gift, also capturing screens and sound reproduction in java script, it is completely flexible adapting to the screen size.

Manipulating the font size of the title using font-size: calc (5vw + 20px); getting a minimum and maximum size already defined changing size according to the size of the browser screen at the moment.

I used ternaries for comparisons.
